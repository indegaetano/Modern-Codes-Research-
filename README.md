# Modern-Codes-Research-
## Research on Cryptography and Math disguised as puzzles. 

Modern Codes was a final project that was made for Writing New Media. This project was inspired by bridging the gap between mathematics and art in a way that will make people appreciate mathematics. This project is an online interactive user game that needs to be paired with the zines that include all the puzzles and codes to progress through the game. The mathematics portion of the project is included in the puzzles that are included in the zines. The project includes an interactive game made in Twine that the user can follow along using zines that were made and designed specifically for the interactive game. There are a total of six zines that are handmade to show the art aspect of the project, three zines that were made digitally, two zines that talk about mathematics as an art, and a solution guide to the codes. The codes in the zines were specifically written to be easy enough for anyone in high school and above to be able to complete. I did many revisions to the zines and the codes that are in them to make sure the instructions were clear and easy to follow.
