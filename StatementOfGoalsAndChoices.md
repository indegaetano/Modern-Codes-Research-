# STATEMENT OF GOALS AND CHOICES
## Modern Codes 
### Content 

Modern Codes was inspired by expressing mathematical ideas as art and poetry. In this artistic approach, the zines and content of the project were carefully curated to ensure that zines displayed creative approaches. For example, the zines and what they are made of are examples of art. I hand-wrote all the codes and tested them over time to ensure they were written correctly and easy to follow. For the poetry, I added quotes from mathematicians that could be poetry. I also want to highlight how mathematics can be poetry as we write strategic proofs like poetry. I specifically made two zines that cover the philosophical concepts that I mentioned. These Zines were full of quotes from mathematicians, and these quotes I thought were like poetry. 

The general goal of this project is to make mathematics accessible to everyone and also alleviate some of the stress that math can cause. I get stressed about math sometimes, but I study long enough for me not to be able to fail. I understand that it is stressful sometimes; it has made me contemplate life choices many times, but at the end of the day, there is nothing else I would rather do. These concepts may seem irrelevant to some, but this is my passion; it keeps me motivated. I want to show math as an art rather than it being displayed in a type set online or in a textbook way. I want to make math more disguised and pretty in the Zines. That is the point of this project, as math can look nice and be fun. 

I am using Zines and Twine to get my points across; the Zines contain some disguised math puzzles that prove math can be fun. Again, I want to make mathematics less scary and possibly fun for others. The significance of this project is that I love mathematics a lot, and this is something I could do further research on. This project is a motivation for me to be in the degree paths that I am in. I am a math major because I love the beauty of mathematics and the way that it logically flows.

### Medium 
Tools Used: Twine and Zines

I chose Twine and Zines as my project mediums. The main medium is Zines; most of the project is based on my zines. I needed an interactive component for the escape room part of the project, so I used Twine. Twine was good for progressing interaction between the project and people, and the zines are a great tool to show the puzzles and math in an excellent way aesthetically. The zines are a great fit for displaying the information artistically, which is what I really wanted to do. The artistic part of the project has to do with the topic that I modeled after mathematics as art. In class and workshops, I learned about the different Zines styles. I used these styles to make my zines for this project. Most of the Zines are all in the classic fold style of zine, and are themed and made with scrapbooking concepts. The only Zine that is different from the classic fold way, is the Zine that I printed from Canva and is the large one.    For Twine, I also learned other things in class, I added different text options in my Twine game. Both the Twine games work well with this project and what they can do. I purposely used these mediums in the project, so coming into the project, I knew the limitations and planned accordingly. The Twine game I made was just like a shell, as one of the limitations for Twine would be if I wanted to make it look artistics and have a bunch of pictures, it would be possible but difficult. The Twine game progresses the player through the game by giving immediate feedback and making the player progress through the "rooms''. The Zines have all the information regarding the puzzles and how to select the correct answer to get to the end of the escape room. The zines are also easier to distribute and give out to people, which is a good distribution for my project. The only limitation was Twine, I could import images into it and other content, but it is much more difficult to do rather than just putting it into the zines. 


In total, there are six zines that are going to be passed out in class for everyone to look at, two zines that talk about the theoretical points, one solution key, and the Canva zines. 


From the beginning of the class and the first workshop, I knew I wanted to use the zine element to make a larger project. In the class workshop times, I learned that you could make zines about whatever you want, but they are a great tool to express ideas through a visual aid. For this project, the zines make sense because I can make them with tangible materials, pretty papers, and other artistic materials.


SIX ZINES MATERIALS: 
I used various materials for the six zines that held the main content and all the puzzles that added to the project's aesthetic. For four of them, I used magazine cuttings of the letters for the covers and the titles, I like how this looked. For another four of them I used old math note pages to make the zines, if you look closely on the pages, you will see equations. The other two zines are made of old book pages. Given the project's content and theme, I went with a vintage look on all the zines as this was the nicest-looking theme. For the inside codes, I printed them and glued them in, and I added scraps of paper and other materials to decorate the inside.


### Writing and Design Process 

Since I have been working on this project for more than half the semester, I was able to ask various people throughout the process of revisions and editing. I mainly asked my best friend to fill out some things and complete the puzzles to get feedback. I also created a Google form and sent that out to different people.  

I have been working on this project for a while, ever since the midterm, and I have done a lot of revisions. When I started and made the zine in Canva, it allowed me to make revisions online. I also took time to think about the puzzles that I wanted to add to the project. I revised the problems multiple times. Throughout the process, I asked many of my friends about the problems that I made to ensure they were easy to understand and complete. I also think about the problems and believe subconsciously and solve them. This quote describes this process: "Often when one works at a hard question, nothing good is accomplished at the first attack. Then one takes a rest, longer or shorter, and sits down anew to the work. During the first half-hour, as before, nothing is found, and then all of a sudden the decisive idea presents itself to the mind." – Poincar ́e, Henri, In: Mathematical creation The Monist (1910): 321-335. ) 

Once I had the complete project draft, I made a Google form and sent that out to friends and family to complete and finish. The results that came from that were that a lot of people could do the project and complete most of the problems. The results surprised me because I would have thought some of my friends who are not stem-related would not be able to complete the project, but they were. The only significant thing I changed was problem four in the zine because from the feedback in the survey, it was the most complex problem. I rewrote it differently and changed it that way. 

The different majors that I had complete my survey included: 
- Chemistry 
- Biology/Environmental Science 
- Computer Science 
- Pre-Med (Computer Science /Biology)
- Psychology 
- Business
  
I wanted to make sure that people not in STEM could complete and understand the content, and they could. The psychology major did well, and so did the biology major. I also asked two children under the age of 14 to complete it, and they did pretty well. 
For the Zines, I just used the Canva Zine as a reference and designed the others accordingly. I really let my creativity take control of creating the other zines and there was no real design process, just what I felt worked with the material. 

### Reflections

I love the puzzles and problems in the project; they are interesting and fun. I also am proud of the concepts and the topic of mathematics as an art. I effectively showed the point that I was trying to make. The two zines I made that are math as an art are my favorite parts and the parts I am most proud of. If I were to repeat this project, I would make the targeted audience very specific and have that down before I even start. Next time it would be interesting to make it for younger children and also a project targeted for people in STEM and higher level maths. I also really liked making all the components in the project. If I make this project again, I think I will use something other than Twine. Sometimes I felt the Twine game was unnecessary, but it worked for this project.
